We investivgated carbon isotope anomalies in the Pacific over the last 20,000 years,  suggesting alkalinity-neutralized carbon was released from a geologic source (analog to OAE). We found that **~2400** gigatons of neutralized carbon could have been added (**~6X** what humans have emitted since the industrial revolution!), <u>without</u> without causing a significant increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> or ocean acidification. This demonstrates **two things:** **1.** the ocean's immense capacity to remove carbon with alkalinity and **2.** the limited impacts it would have on the marine system, globaly and regionally. Our first manuscript outlining this work is under review at <strong>*Geophysical Research Letters*</strong>, and we have one more publication in preparation.

<!-- - To do this, we built a regional model for the Gulf of California region where the carbon isotope anomalies are observed, and coupled the model to a global carbon cycle model. We then developed numerical inversion methods to assimilate reconstructed carbon cycle changes and quantify how much alkalinity-neutralized carbon was plausible. -->
