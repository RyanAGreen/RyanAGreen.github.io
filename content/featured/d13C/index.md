Carbon isotopes (i.e., δ<sup>13</sup>C) can be used to verify carbon dioxide removal by providing a unique fingerprint from the atmospheric carbon source (i.e., [The Suess Effect](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/isotopes/c13tellsus.html), see NOAA figure on right). We built a carbon isotope-enabled mixed-layer box model and simulated simplified ocean alkalinity enhancement experiments, comparing the δ<sup>13</sup>C signal to other carbonate parameters. Our preliminary results suggest that the δ<sup>13</sup>C signal after mCDR will last longer than other carbonate parameters, therefore making it easier to detect and verify the carbon uptake (aka the monitoring, reporting, and verification – MRV) after OAE.
