This project will use the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) built for the California Current System ([CCS-ROMS](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013GB004683)) to simulate various OAE experiments with different locations and dispersal techniques. The coast of California has been designated as an [ideal location](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/20/27/2023/) for OAE. Our simulations will be conducted at a spatial resolution of 3 km, and thus provide valuable insights into the localized impacts, far-field detectability of added carbon storage, and overall efficiency of different OAE scenarios.
