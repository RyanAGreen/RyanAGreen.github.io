I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the [Earth System Biogeochemistry Group](https://earth-system-biogeochemistry.net/).

I use biogeochemical modeling to research [marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR)](https://oceanvisions.org/ocean-based-carbon-dioxide-removal/), specifically through [ocean alkalinity enhancement](https://www.dosi-project.org/wp-content/uploads/Alkalinity-Enhancement-Policy-Brief.pdf).
