- While playing and coaching American Football in Australia, I performed research through the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales.

- I was awarded a Summer Vacation Research Scholarship ($3,800) and worked with Prof. Katrin Meissner and Prof. Laurie Menviel.

- Analyzed seasonal sea-ice cover at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) from global circulation models.

- Determined the most likely summer and winter sea-ice edge at the LGM and constrained the mechanisms controlling sea ice in the different models.
