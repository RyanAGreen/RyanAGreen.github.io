- Received a research scholarship ($3800) to conduct research at the [Climate Change Research Centre](https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/ccrc) at the University of New South Wales, while playing and coaching American football in Australia

- Analyzed seasonal sea-ice cover at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) from global circulation models under the supervision of [Prof. Katrin Meissner](https://katrinmeissner.org/) and [Prof. Laurie Menviel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gHh0AfoAAAAJ&hl=en)

- Constrained the mechanisms controlling sea ice in the different models and determined the most likely summer and winter sea-ice edge at the LGM
