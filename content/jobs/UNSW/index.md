- Received a scholarship ($3800) to conduct research at the [Climate Change Research Centre](https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/ccrc) within the University of New South Wales, while I was playing and coaching American football in Australia

- I worked with [Prof. Katrin Meissner](https://katrinmeissner.org/) and [Prof. Laurie Menviel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gHh0AfoAAAAJ&hl=en)

- We analyzed seasonal sea-ice cover at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), to determine the most likely summer and winter sea-ice edge. Additionally, we constrained the mechanisms controlling sea ice in the PMIP3 and PMIP4 simulations.
