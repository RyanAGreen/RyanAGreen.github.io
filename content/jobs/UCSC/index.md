- I am advised by Dr. Mathis P. Hain and co-advised by Dr. Patrick A. Rafter.

- Investivgated carbon isotope anomalies in the Pacific over the last 20,000 years â€“ which suggest  alkalinity-neutralized carbon was released from a geologic source (analog to OAE).

- Built a regional model for the Gulf of California region where the carbon isotope anomalies are observed.

- Developed a numerical inversion of a coupled global/regional carbon cycle model to assimilate reconstructed carbon cycle changes and quantify how much alkalinity-neutralized carbon was plausible.

- Investigated the use of carbon isotopes as a tool for verifying CO<sub>2</sub> uptake after mCDR.

- Simulating various OAE experiments using a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) built for the California Current System.
