Welcome! I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. with a focus on carbonate chemistry and biogeochemical modeling. Specifically, I'm fascinated by the potential of [Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE)](https://www.dosi-project.org/wp-content/uploads/Alkalinity-Enhancement-Policy-Brief.pdf) as a tool for marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR).

Through my research, I've explored a range of projects related to OAE, from researching geologic analogs to OAE from the **20,000 years ago**, to simulating various OAE techniques along the west coast of the United States. I'm also interested in the use of **carbon isotopes** as a way to verify carbon uptake.

Outside of my research, I enjoy staying active and spending time outdoors. Some of my favorite activities include playing sports, cooking, and traveling with friends and family.

Here is a list of the programming languages I use and the scientific topics that I am interested in!
